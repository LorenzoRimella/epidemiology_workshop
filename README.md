# Workshop on epidemiology

This tutorial focuses on leveraging TensorFlow within the context of epidemiological modeling. We begin with a concise introduction to fundamental TensorFlow commands, elucidating techniques for tensor management, broadcasting, and harnessing the power of the "einsum" notation. In addition to TensorFlow, we explore some commands of TensorFlow Probability, revealing how probabilistic programming facilitates tasks such as sampling and effortless computation of probability mass functions (p.m.f.) and log p.m.f.

Subsequently, we dive into the world of epidemiological modeling simulation, and specifically compartmental modelling, with the classic SIR model serving as our guiding example. Within this segment, we show how to implement a compartmental model efficiently, emphasizing the importance of implementation choices that enable parallel simulation of multiple models.

The final section of our tutorial is dedicated to inference. We commence by exploring vanilla Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and illustrate how it yields an approximation of the posterior distribution over model parameters, progressively refining the prior domain. As we conclude, our focus shifts to the Poisson Approximation Likelihood (PAL), where we approximate the likelihood of the compartmental model using a Poisson distribution. We delve into the core steps of the recursion and elucidate how to design the PAL for efficient parallel execution across various parameter choices. Beyond merely plotting profile likelihoods for the parameters of interest, we also unveil the techniques for gradient computation and parameter optimization through a TensorFlow optimizer.
